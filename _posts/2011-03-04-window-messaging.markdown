The building where I work is in an area of new development and 
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com) are our neighbours.  A lot of the buildings in
the area are unfinished but they're slowly becoming populated; People appeared
next door a few weeks ago and they started writing a message in Post-It notes.

Not to be outdone, I decided that Post-Its weren't a reasonable response from a
tech company.  Enter the giant QR code.

This QR code points to [BigDoor's](http://www.bigdoor.com/) website and it works
pretty well.  I hope the QR code is the reason for the truncation of "are" and
the addition of "hi!" in their message; there's always the possibility they
happen to be talking to the floor above.
