My writing has been almost non-existant for the past couple of years and I'm
yet to find a real reason why. Maybe I just haven't had anything interesting to
write about. Maybe it's all [Twitter's](http://twitter.com/splee) fault.  It's
probably just a preference for relaxing after a long day at work; work that I
pour all my creativity into, leaving little for my own projects.

Whatever the reason, it's going to change.

I'm setting up a new blog purely for my technical writing here.  This blog
is powered by Github and the Jekyll engine they provide; simply set up the
correct directory structure, push with Git and presto: new blog.

Expect more here in the near future.
